Look for a LiIo with matching voltage (e.g. 4S vs. 6S) and then find a mAh that is as close in weight as you can. There isn't a lot of variance in the mAh capacity of LiIo cells, so you may not have much selection. Each 18650 cell will be about 3500 mAh at most; each 21700 cell will be about 6000 mAh at most. In most cases, the LiIo pack will be a little heavier than the LiPo it replaces, but will give significantly longer flight time.\n\nLi-Io packs will be either 1P or 2P. Such as \"3000 mAh 4S\" (this is a 1P) or \"3000 mAh 6S2P\" (this is a 2P). A 1P pack will be good for up to about 30-40 amps at most. A 2P pack wil lbe good for about 60-80 amps. Make sure to buy a pack that can support the current that suits your expected use.\n\nFinally, be careful NOT to buy packs intended for use with FPV goggles. These packs will cost less, but also have extremely low C-rate and will not be good for flying with.\n\nShop for Li-Io packs at:\n* GetFPV - https://bit.ly/3MzBlAH\n* RaceDayQuads - https://bit.ly/3QrWttN\n* NewBeeDrone - https://bit.ly/3SbhI5w\n* GEPRC - https://bit.ly/3tAuArq\n* iFlight- https://bit.ly/46WOEmj\n\nMANDATORY DISCLAIMER: I am a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for me to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.\n\n---\n\n00:00:00 - How can Lithium Ion be 2x the capacity for the same weight?!\n00:00:20 - Maybe the specs are lying?

Keto Chow comes in over 30 flavors including classic favorites like strawberry, banana, and cookies&cream with some more specialized flavors like lemon meringue, blueberry pie, and gingerbread. Most people mix it up like a shake with water and heavy cream, but you can use melted butter, coconut oil, avocado oil, or any other fat that you like. A single shake mixes up in about 30 seconds, and stores in the fridge for up to six days, so they\u2019re great for people who don\u2019t have time to make elaborate meals 3x a day. The recipe is open-source, and the creator did an experiment where he ate ONLY Keto Chow for 100 days and published blood tests, food logs, and loads of other data on his blog.

I wanna go fast, but I'm not a super athlete mountain biker. The electric motor in this bike makes me as fast in real life as I am in my dreams. It hits 15-20 mph with almost zero effort, if I turn up the variable-strength assist to the max.

So they had to remove everything again, clean PCBs and parts, modify placement data, and re-do everything. That was a lot of expensive manual work. This error didn't break the FCs, though, because I was able to fix that manually (about 50 fixes for each F7 prototype).\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s Barely News\n\nDremel Tool Helicopter\n* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-omkIPBKn0\n\nTaco Bell Uses Drones In Commercial, We Can\u2019t Show It\n* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZskNKOO4GU\n\nGlendale Arizona Residents Don\u2019t Like Drone Deliveries\n* https://www.azfamily.com/2023/01/07/do-it-somewhere-else-glendale-residents-asking-walmart-stop-drone-delivery-service/\n\nDrone Light Show Record Broken, 1001 Drones\n* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2xe-ZRxmc\n\nAmazon Now Doing Drone Deliveries In CA and TX\n* https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/12/amazon-begins-drone-deliveries-in-california-and-texas/\n\nUK Drone Idiot Pleads Guilty to Being an Idiot\n* https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/drone-pilot-pleads-guilty-to-endangering-raf-hurricane/\n\nRasp Pi Compute Module Integrated FCs\n* https://www.cbunmanned.com/home\n\nMobigital O3\n* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJVvf0RC96w"

Here are some highlights to look forward to!\n* RC/FF Improvements by Chris Thompson - https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/pull/10650\n* Essentially the code for RC Filtering has been reworked, and some bugs have been fixed in Feedforward. Now you can go from really low smoothing, to auto_smoothness values that are really high for extremely cine-smoothed inputs.\n* KarateBrot has a new SDFT, which is a new digital fourier transform with a better bin size, which will allow much better notch filtering.\n* Currently the dynamic notch is a single notch, using a larger bin size so it is less accurate, and would scale based on a fixed Q factor so would be larger at lower frequency and smaller at higher.\n* The new dynamic notch has twice the bin count, allows for up to 5 notches, and lets you define the bandwidth of the notches instead of relying on the fixed Q like before.\n\n55:37 - Holybro Tekko32 metal F3 ESC recalled?\n* https://www.racedayquads.com/products/holybro-tekko32-f3-metal-4in1-blheli32\n* https://imgur.com/a/nRmwFn0\n\n58:55 - WeBleed Whoop Series Update/Reminder!\n* https://docs.google.com/document/d/18qeV48aPZQD5cz3OSH2Tr_3M4DQaZ0E0Kkkc5HMQP6U/edit\n* Qualifying ends for all three tracks THIS friday April 9th at 11:59 PM PST\n* Draft is on April 18th at 8pm EST\n* Total Prize Pool is $2634!\n* Blunty\u2019s Best Lap on Track 1 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y58adsce2sU\n\n1:02:17 - FrSky X20 HD FPV vendor confirmed not to be DJI.\n* FrSky and DJI both deny that the X20 FPV receiver is DJI compatible.\n* DJI quote: \u201cUnaware of this product \u2013 we\u2019re not working with FrSky on it.\u201d\n* No immediate response from Fat Shark"

Skyzone released an updated firmware to fix this. In addition, Skyzone is working to improve the performance of the RF module in some edge cases. You should flash the goggle and module to the latest firmware upon receipt. \n\nThe Sky04X ships with a \"sleep\" function that turns the screens off after several minutes of inactivity. In some cases, this can cause the screens to turn off while flying. This can be disabled in the goggle setup menu, and I recommend doing so.\n\nPurchase the Eachine EV300O at:\n* Banggood - https://bit.ly/3r2nUg3\n\nMy review of the EV300O (and by extension the Sky04X, since it's the same goggle but with upgraded screens): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZjLjgk1-Cw\n\nPurchase the Fat Shark Attitude V6 at:\n* Rotor Riot - https://bit.ly/3n3ZKzd\n* GetFPV - http://bit.ly/3ajFG8K\n* ReadyMadeRC - https://bit.ly/2VYJkMI\n* Banggood - https://bit.ly/3aiY95m\n\nMy review of the Aittitude v6: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sfR8ny2BQ0\n\nPurchase the Eachine EV200D at:\n* GetFPV - http://bit.ly/326oGMF\n* Banggood - https://bit.ly/3nUsv1M\n\nMy review of the EV200D: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OR76a2zHPcE\n\nPurchase the Eachine EV800D at:\n* Banggood - https://bit.ly/3aCG7Jb\n* GetFPV - https://bit.ly/3HToNA5\n* RaceDayQuads - https://bit.ly/3nV7o1U\n\nPurchase the FXT Viper V2 at:\n* GetFPV - http://bit.ly/2u3tQZC\n* RaceDayQuads - https://bit.ly/37RNqNz\n* Banggood - https://bit.ly/2WMvBsG\n* Amazon - https://amzn.to/2MKYQFy\n\nMy review of the FXT Viper V1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ESz6cUEeww\n\nPurchase the Skyzone Sky03O at: \n* RaceDayQuads - http://bit.ly/2Ibm8US\n* Banggood - https://bit.ly/3mO3jIV\n\nMy review of the Sky03O: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy1dOvwU10M\n\nPurchase the Skyzone Sky02C at:\n* Amazon - https://amzn.to/3mVYyNw\n\nPurchase the Fat Shark Scout at:\n* GetFPV - http://bit.ly/32T5ja6\n* Rotor Riot - https://bit.ly/2KTkPON\n* RaceDayQuads - http://bit.ly/2ZjE4Dn\n* Amazon - https://amzn.to/2JlShNo\n* Banggood - https://bit.ly/3o6bodL\n\nPurchase the Fat Shark Recon at:\n* Rotor Riot - https://bit.ly/38DodFM\n* Banggood - https://bit.ly/3o6bodL\n* Amazon - https://amzn.to/38BADhn\n\nSkyzone Cobra\n* Banggood - https://bit.ly/37S493j\n\nMANDATORY DISCLAIMER: I am a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for me to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.\n\nMost or all links above are affiliate links, and I will receive compensation if you use them.\n\n--- TOC ---\n\n0:00 - Intro\n1:44 - The most feature-packed, future-proof goggles you can buy\n4:01 - Best image quality / screens\n7:01 - Best value around $350\n9:59 - Cheapest binocular-style goggle worth having\n12:10 - Best goggle under $100\n13:07 - Best goggle for people who wear glasses\n14:27 - Best box goggle at any price\n16:55 - Best goggle for Shark Byte\n18:49 - What about DJI?\n20:48 - Conclusion"

By default the FC uses both gyros, and if one gyro goes bad, then it flies like it has a bad gyro. But you can just change it to use only one of the two gyros (the good one)!"

No joke.\n\n2:25 - DJI has perfectly dealt with the issue of graceful signal degradation in flight.\n\n3:25 - Image quality from DJI camera. Can you give up your GoPro?\n\n4:00 - What about Latency?\n\n5:04 - Price. How much more expensive is DJI than other typical setups?\n\nMISC. QUESTIONS AND MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT THE DJI FPV SYSTEM\n\n9:45 - Does DJI interfere with existing analog vTX systems?\n\n11:08 - Will the DJI system work with race timing systems?\n\n11:30 - Doee the DJI system integrate with Betaflight OSD?\n\nDOWNSIDES AND GOTCHAS\n\n12:51 - Cost (discussed previously). Size and weight?\n\n13:47 - Micro quads mean that analog video is definitely not dead yet!\n\n14:17 - DJI's biggest misstep: leaving out an analog receiver.\n\n15:42 - DJI supports only up to 4S. Does not support 5S and 6S natively.\n\n16:02 - The fit of the goggles is awful. Also, glasses-wearers will have to wear goggles over their glasses.\n\n16:57 - Range is dramatically shorter in Europe / CE regions. Only 700 meters vs. 4 miles in USA.\n\n18:08 - The single biggest reason I think you might pass up the DJI system. The social aspect.\n\n20:45 - What about Fat Shark Byte Frost?"

Now Holybro has made it even better, with the Rotor Riot Special Edition.\n\nWhy is it better? The simple answer is the motors. I had no idea how versatile a 2150 kv motor would be. This quad can fly for extended cruises or proximity freesylte on 4S, normal freestyle on 5S, and to-the-moon acceleration on 6S. And when you combine it with a throttle curve, you can ditch the other batteries and just run 6S, and switch flight feel using your transmitter.\n\n--- PRODUCT LINKS ---\n\nI receive a commission (at no extra cost to you) if you make a purchase after clicking one of the affiliate links below.\n\nPurchase the Kopis 2 Rotor Riot Special Edition at:\n* Rotor Riot Store - http://bit.ly/2IhvIov\n* RaceDayQuads - http://bit.ly/2Ii71sk\n* Banggood - http://bit.ly/2IhYGER\n\nMANDATORY DISCLAIMER: I am a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for me to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.\n\nMost or all links above are affiliate links, and I will receive compensation if you use them."

It's got a multi-protocol module that can bind to FrSky, FlySky, Spektrum, and more. It even can take a Crossfire module without modification.\n\nWhat more could you ask for? Two things. If the radio had Hall Effect gimbals and if the multiprotocol module was built in instead of being in the external bay, then this would be a nearly-perfect radio.

With the new 3.0 release, physics match the real world closer than they ever have. The real question is, what would make you choose DRL simulator over another sim like Velocidrone or Liftoff? We'll go through the new 3.0 DRL Simulator release in this video.\n\n---\n\nThe DRL Simulator is available on Steam at:\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/641780/The_Drone_Racing_League_Simulator/?fbclid=IwAR1rD1MIAewoRWBVoRcds4SWdHS5mvQztM25a5feVtJk-yyawUoEmHKiVE0"

What's the difference between the RR edition and the IRC edition? As long as we've got it out, let's use it to test the output power of some video transmitters.\n\nThe ImmersionRC RF Power Meter v2 finally puts ACCURATE power measurement within reach of hobbyists. This tool is essential for anybody running FPV drone races. Or if you're just a nerd who likes testing video transmitters and other types of radios.\n\nThe v2 power meter beats the v1 in several ways. It's smaller. it has a built-in battery. It has a few new modes. And it's CALIBRATED from the factory to be ACCURATE, including a build-in load resistor, which was a source of serious inaccuracy in the v1 meter.\n\n--- PRODUCT LINKS ---\n\nI receive a commission (at no extra cost to you) if you make a purchase after clicking one of the affiliate links below.\n\nPurchase the ImmersionRC RF Power meter V2 at...\n* Rotor Riot (adapters included) - http://bit.ly/2y5eiXo\n\nSame price, adapters not included at:\n* Banggood - http://bit.ly/2KlpvYd\n * GetFPV - http://bit.ly/2GdRSVL\n* ReadyMadeRC - http://bit.ly/2KjfACo\n* RaceDayQuads - http://bit.ly/2wDcqHJ\n\nMANDATORY DISCLAIMER: I am a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for me to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.\n\nMost or all links above are affiliate links, and I will receive compensation if you use them."

Using the 4-in-1 plug saves a ton of soldering and makes replacement of FC or ESC easy. \n\nHere's the problem: the plugs on FCs and ESCs are usually not compatible. You can't just plug in your FC and ESC and expect it to work. It may even fry the FC or ESC! \n\nSo let's learn how to connect FC to ESC using a 4-in-1 plug.

It has un-populated pads for you to add your own tantalum capacitors. The current sensor is pre-calibrated and uses Hall Effect instead of a shunt resistor, so it's always correct, and it doesn't bleed any power as heat (not even a tiny bit).\n\nAt the time of this video's release, the Omnibus Fireworks V2 is not widely available. The V1 looks almost the same but it doesn't have the cutouts on the corners for the ESC wires. Also, the ribbon cable on the V1 is outside the board and is more vulnerable. The V1 is a fine FC but don't accidentally buy the V1 if you want the V2.\n\nhttps://store.myairbot.com/flight-controller/omnibus-f3-f4/omnibusfireworksv2.html\n\nhttps://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?3054987-OMNIBUS-Fireworks-v2-from-Airbot\n\nhttp://pirofliprc.com/OMNIBUS-Fireworks-v2_p_5757.html"

It detects and prevents a bug in the gyro that causes your quadcopter to yaw-spin to the moon (also known as YSTTM). \n\nIf you aren't expecting this feature, it can cause you to think your quadcopter is defective. The problem that led me to this discovery is a person reporting their quadcopter would keep doing backflips even though it wasn't commanded to.\n\nFortunately, you can turn this feature off if you want to.\n\nI'll show you what this feature looks like when it kicks in and how to turn it off if you don't want it any more."

Here are other ways that you can support me: https://www.fpvknowitall.com/support-me/\n\n\n--- \n\nWHAT IS BUTTERFLIGHT? It's a fork of Betaflight. The Betaflight devs replaced the Kalman filter with a different one. Butterflight contains both filters so people can test which is better.\n\nHOW DO YOU INSTALL BUTTERFLIGHT? Instructions are in this video. Download from here: http://butterflight.co/\n\nIS BUTTERFLIGHT BETTER THAN BETAFLIGHT? Not even gonna touch that one. But I have some sample footage you can watch and start to form an opinion.\n\nHelio RC flight controller with Butterflight pre-installed available from: https://heliorc.com/\n\n--- BUTTERFLIGHT CONFIGURATION DUMP ---\n\nThis version sets the stage2 and kalman lowpass to 250 Hz, and disables the dynamic notch filter. This is the approach suggested by some Betaflight devs that I interviewed. This approach has approximately the same latency as the other approach, but has significantly lower CPU utilization because the dynamic filter is off. However, this approach is slightly more likely to burn your motors because the static filters don't respond to a broken prop or something like that.\n\n--- COPY FROM HERE BUT NOT INCLUDING THIS LINE ---\n\nfeature AIRMODE\nfeature ANTI_GRAVITY\nfeature -DYNAMIC_FILTER\nset gyro_notch1_hz = 0\nset gyro_notch2_hz = 0\nset cpu_overclock = 192MHZ\nset gyro_use_32khz = ON\nset gyro_sync_denom = 1\nset pid_process_denom = 2\nset acc_hardware = NONE\nset mag_hardware = NONE\nset baro_hardware = NONE\nset dterm_lowpass_type = PT1\nset dterm_notch_hz = 0\nset gyro_lowpass_type = PT1\nset gyro_lowpass_hz = 90\n\n# ONLY PASTE IN ONE OF THESE LINES DEPENDING ON WHICH FILTER\n# YOU WANT TO TEST OUT.

Then it enables the dynamic filter to cover the motor frequencies. This approach is recommended by the Butterflight devs. It is more CPU intensive, but it is also probably more likely to resist smoking the motors because the dynamic filter can respond to broken props and stuff like that.\n\n--- COPY FROM HERE BUT NOT INCLUDING THIS LINE ---\n# feature\nfeature AIRMODE\nfeature ANTI_GRAVITY\nfeature DYNAMIC_FILTER\nset gyro_notch1_hz = 0\nset gyro_notch2_hz = 0\nset cpu_overclock = 192MHZ\nset gyro_use_32khz = ON\nset gyro_sync_denom = 1\nset pid_process_denom = 2\nset acc_hardware = NONE\nset mag_hardware = NONE\nset baro_hardware = NONE\nset dterm_lowpass_type = PT1\nset dterm_notch_hz = 0\nset gyro_lowpass_type = PT1\nset gyro_lowpass_hz = 90\n\n# ONLY PASTE IN ONE OF THESE LINES DEPENDING ON WHICH FILTER\n# YOU WANT TO TEST OUT.

Basically, the worst-performance most people will experience (which is still pretty impressive to be honest).\n\n6:09 - Typical best 3.2 setup for most quads. Default settings, dynamic notch enabled, D term lowpass changed Biquad to PT1. Both gyro notches disabled. D term notch NOT DISABLED. Although disabling D term notch would give better performance, many quads can't disable it without getting hot motors, so I left it on to try to reflect a more typical experience.\n\n7:45 - \"Betaflight Dev Approach\". BF 3.3 stage2 configuration. All notch filters disabled (gyro, d term, and dynamic). Stage2 filter at 150 Hz. 32 kHz gyro, 16 kHz PID loop.\n\n10:14 - Same as before, but now stage2 filter is raised from 150 to 250 Hz.\n\n11:36 - Same as before, but now the gyro and PID loop are both running at 8 kHz, such as would be on a FC using MPU6000 gyro, which cannot run at 32 kHz.\n\n13:06 - \"UAV Tech's Approach\". All notch filters disabled, except dynamic notch enabled. Stage2 cutoff at 500 Hz. 32 kHz gyro, 16 kHz PID.\n\n--- WHO IS UAV TECH AND WHERE IS HIS YOUTUBE CHANNEL ---\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/spatzengr\n\n--- THE QUAD IN THIS VIDEO IS ---\n\nFrame: OwlRC Dragon\n* Banggood: https://goo.gl/X2GLvM\n* ReadymadeRC: https://goo.gl/HBNFoj\n\nPurchase the Matek F405 flight controller here:\n* Banggood - https://goo.gl/7QBx79\n* GetFPV - https://goo.gl/jvYDJS\n\nPurchase the FCHUB vTX here:\n* Banggood - https://goo.gl/oa5U8K\n* GetFPV (does not appear to carry it--sorry)\n\nPurchase the Axii \"Stubby\" antenna here:\n* GetFPV - https://goo.gl/J9an3V\n\nPurchase the FrSky R-XSR here:\n* Banggood - https://goo.gl/M12u7W\n* GetFPV - https://goo.gl/z6zG9h\n\nPurchase the Lumenier POPO MX2206 / 2450kv motor here:\n* GetFPV - https://goo.gl/2uQPnE\n\nPurchase the Lumenier \"GateBreaker\" 5x5.3x3 prop here:\nhttps://goo.gl/3cqFAa\n\nMost links above are affiliate links, and I will receive compensation if you use them."

And one of the most exciting is \"anti-taz\" , also known as Runaway Takeoff Prevention.\n\nYou know how, your quad can FLIP OUT if you put your prop on wrong, or if your flight controller is facing the wrong way, or if your motor is spinning the wrong way? Anti-taz fixes that. The quad still won't fly, but at least it won't FLIP OUT and try to eat your face. It'll just disarm.\n\nThe good news is that anti-taz is on by default in Betaflight 3.3. You don't have to set it up or tune it. But you might want to at least see what it looks like when it kicks in, because people are already telling me, \"Betaflight 3.3 is broken!\" That's like saying, \"I was in an accident and my seat belt held me in my seat instead of letting me fly through the windshield. THIS CAR IS BROKEN.\"\n\nHere's the wiki page that documents this feature:\nhttps://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/wiki/Runaway-Takeoff-Prevention"

We all pretty much agree these days that 2.8mm is too narrow, but how wide is too wide? I think I finally found my answer. This test DRAMATICALLY shows the effects of going to a wider-angle lens: more peripheral vision, but obstacles seem to jump out at you suddenly, it's harder to hit small gaps, and hitting the apex of turns is more difficult.\n\n--- PRODUCT LINKS --- \n\nRuncam Eagle V2 Pro\n* Banggood - https://goo.gl/7Fzz7Q\n* Amazon - http://amzn.to/2zuqYqQ\n\nThe quad in the video is the Karearea Talon.

I haven't tried it myself yet, but I've been told by one pilot that it comes as close as possible to Betaflight matching an Inductrix-based Whoop's handling.\n\nProject Mockingbird is here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1N_GNXWuGPWg2IeCG8EKqiURUd8s29HyRlaH4-ivzjH4/edit?usp=sharing"

In fact, I think it is a contender for best \"beginner\" plug-n-fly quadcopter. But if there was one thing I'd change about it, it'd be the motors.\n\nThen I noticed that I have some EFAW 2407 motors just waiting for a quad to put them in.\n\nThe difference between the T-Motor Air40 motors that come on the Kopis and the EFAW is night and day. The T-Motor Airs are small, light, smooth, and inexpensive. But not ultra powerful or torquey. The EFAW 2407 is... well, come on. 24. 07. What more do you need to see?\n\nBut just because motor is bigger and more powerful doesn't mean it'll make a quad fly better. And what about the amp draw?

They lack a few usability features that are found even on goggles half their price. For $200, the Transformer SE Binocular Bundle should be carefully compared to other box goggles in that price range to see if the pro's outweigh the cons.

      "description": "Uncertain about what to buy? Check out THE ULTIMATE FPV SHOPPING LIST: https://www.fpvknowitall.com\n\nPlease consider supporting me via Patreon: www.patreon.com/thedroneracingengineer\n\n---\n\nThe Q6 and T8 are two new LiPo battery chargers from ISDT. Q6 packs 300 watts into an unbelievably tiny package. T8 delivers 1000 watts for when you need MOAR POWAH. Both of them are incredibly feature-rich and value-priced.\n\nBut there's a catch.\n\nThe 300 watt and 1000 watt rating of the chargers is based on charging at the maximum possible voltage (6S for the Q6, 8S for the T8). This inflates the specification a bit if you're actually charging 4S or lower, as most of us are. So if you're looking for the best LiPo charger, you should probably look at the amp rating (14 amps for the Q6 and 30 amps for the T8) not the watt rating. \n\nEven taking this into account, I think these are some of the best value for the money you can buy today.\n\n--- PRODUCT LINKS ---\n\nISDT Q6\n* Banggood - https://goo.gl/YmK3N8\n* GetFPV - https://goo.gl/AiAF9e\n* ReadyMadeRC - https://goo.gl/Jt3RjB\n* Amazon - https://amzn.to/2IiVdI8\n* Rotor Riot Store - http://bit.ly/2xWVp8W\n\nISDT T8\n* Banggood - https://goo.gl/DWPnbS\n* Amazon - http://amzn.to/2CFqcI6\n* GetFPV - http://bit.ly/2JR5bRH\n\nISDT SC-620\n* Banggood - https://goo.gl/AWTXcj\n* GetFPV - https://goo.gl/NqxYrg\n* Amazon - http://amzn.to/2xH361K\n\nMANDATORY DISCLAIMER: I am a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for me to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.\n\nMost or all links above are affiliate links, and I will receive compensation if you use them."

With this feature, you can operate the OSD menu of your FPV camera from your transmitter. NO MORE TINY JOYSTICKS to plug in in the field.\n\nTHIS IS A GAME CHANGER. Now you don't need to find the \"best camera settings\" for every situation. You can just tweak brightness and contrast and etc. as need be.\n\nThanks to Andrey Mironov (diehertz) for being the primary developer of this feature.\n\nWhen choosing a capacitor, use 1 to 10 microfarad if you are using software PWM.

      "description": "The Holybro Kopis is the best $300 ready-to-fly racing drone you can buy today. And I don't say that lightly. \n\nThe single biggest reason I love this quad so much is that it flies great. The first time I flew it I was blown away with how effortless freestyle felt.\n\n--- PRODUCT LINKS --- \n\nPurchase the Holybro Kopis 1 Racing Drone here:\n\n* Banggood - https://goo.gl/ubyTgG\n* GetFPV - https://goo.gl/dTUyrb\n\nDownload the manual for the Kopis here: http://files.banggood.com/2016/12/Holybro%20KOPIS%201%20Manual%20v1.1-0828.pdf\n\n---\n\nThe quad has all the features you could ask for. Betaflight OSD. vTX that can be controlled from the OSD or your Taranis. BLHeli_32 ESCs supporting Dshot1200. A proper RunCam Swift Mini FPV camera. Holybro has completely NAILED the spec sheet with this one.\n\nThe T-Motor Air motors are hardly cutting-edge, but with the quad coming at just over 300 grams, the motors hardly feel weak. Check the freestyle video in this review and see for yourself if the quad looks slow.\n\nYou can probably name a few other quads that go faster than the Kopis. But they cost way more. I can't think of a single ready-to-fly quad in the Kopis price range that matches its features and flight performance.\n\nDid I mention I wrote the user manual for the Kopis? It's everything you need to do to get into the air when you buy this quad. You won't get that with any other quad."

      "description": "Uncertain about what to buy? Check out THE ULTIMATE FPV SHOPPING LIST: https://www.fpvknowitall.com\n\nPlease consider supporting content like this via Patreon: www.patreon.com/thedroneracingengineer\n\n---\n\nBetaflight 3.2 and BLHeli now support Dshot Commands. Two of the most interesting Dshot Commands are \"turtle mode\" and \"esc beeper\" mode. ESC beeper means the motors beep when you flick a switch, so you don't need a separate beeper to find your lost quad in the tall grass. Turtle mode lets you temporarily reverse your motors so you can flip back over when you crash upside down.\n\nYOU'RE GONNA LEARN HOW TO MAKE YOUR QUAD DO IT.\n\nExcited? Let's go.\n\n---\n\nThe video about setting up flight modes is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLy28mYiAzU\n\n---\n\nA FEW IMPORTANT NOTES:\n\n1. Until Betaflight 3.2 RC6, you need to go to the CLI and type \"set small_angle=180\" to make turtle mode work. I do this on all my quads as part of my default setup so I didn't notice it was necessary. This will allow your quad to arm at any angle (even if you are carrying it in your hands) so be careful.\n\n2. If you aren't using nylock nuts, you are more likely to unscrew a prop when using turtle mode.\n\n3. BLHeli_32 does NOT support Dshot commands by default. I tested this on an RTF quad with _32 ESCs but apparently they were already flashed with the correct firmware. If you are running BLHeli_32 you need one of the firmwares from Github to support Dshot Commands. You can download them here:\n\nhttps://1drv.ms/u/s!Al4b3QGPtgasmKwONsizGMLypM31vg\n\nYou need to flash either the Wraith .hex file or the Spedix .hex file depending on which one is correct for your ESC. Use the \"Flash Local File\" option on BLHeliSuite.\n\n4. BEEPER MODE WILL MELT YOUR MOTORS if you leave it running too long. Don't just set it on and leave it for 3 minutes while you search for your quad. Flip it on, let the motors beep a few times, then listen and turn it off.\n\n5. If you are trying to do Dshot ESC Beeper and it's not working, here's a likely cause. Betaflight RC6 added a feature to let you choose to use your regular beeper instead of the motor beeper. So by default, the motor beeper is turned off.\nIf you want to turn it on, go to the CLI and type:\n\nset beeper_dshot_beacon_tone = 1\nsave"

THE WINNER HAS BEEN SELECTED.\n\nYou guys are really in for a treat with today's video. I did an hour long interview with Randy Rubinstein of SRA Solder (www.sra-solder.com) about all the stuff you beginners are doing wrong when you solder. And yeah, Randy has been doing this forever, so the pros will probably learn something too.\n\nOH BY THE WAY WE'RE GIVING AWAY AN $80 SOLDERING STATION.\n\nIf you're using typical 60/40 solder, you should be using something else. (Hint: THIS IS IT https://www.sra-solder.com/rosin-flux-core-solder-63-37-032-inch-1-pound-spool)\n\nIs rosin-core solder sufficient, or must you use flux?\n\nWhat temperature should your iron be at?\n\nIs it mandatory to clean flux residue from a board?\n\nCan you get lead exposure from solder, and should you use lead-free solder?\n\nWE WILL ANSWER ALL OF THESE QUESTIONS. And give away an $80 soldering station to boot.\n\nThe soldering station we are giving away is: https://www.sra-solder.com/aoyue-9378-digital-soldering-station\n\n---\n\nOFFICIAL RULES\n\n1.

      "description": "The HypeTrain is Rotor Riot's entry into the 2306 motor class. It's designed for freestyle pilots: enough power to impress with big punchouts, but not so much that your batteries all give up and die. It's smooth and tunable. And surprisingly efficient!\n\nIn this video, I'll talk you through the design decisions that Rotor Riot made when they created this motor, such as: solid-core wire with silver plating, open bottom, and using a screw instead of a C-clip on the motor shaft. Then we'll take a look at their thrust test results. Finally, I'll give you my conclusion about who this motor is best for.\n\n--- Product links ---\n\nHypeTrain Freestyle 2450kv\n* GetFPV  - https://goo.gl/svxMDN\n* Rotor Riot - http://bit.ly/2L71qoI\n* RaceDayQuads - http://bit.ly/2L4roJt\n* Amazon - https://amzn.to/2zufMyf\n\nThe links above are affiliate links and I will receive a small commission if you use it."

      "description": "GetFPV just sent out their notification that they have the RR HypeTrain motor in stock. I have about 20 packs through this motor and I have to say that it's a really excellent freestyle motor. \n\nIf you want to order this motor, move fast, because they will sell out quickly. And if you choose to use my affiliate link, of course I would appreciate that too.\n\nhttp://www.getfpv.com/rotor-riot-hypetrain-freestyle-2306-2450kv-motor.html?cmid=eHZ3Y2tBWGYrQWM9&afid=bXNoK0JSMUViaGc9&ats=ZFNOTFdoUEM1V2s9\n\nMy full video review will be out tomorrow. A teaser flight is linked above. It's one of my early shake-down flights so the goal is to test the motors' performance, not make an entertaining freestyle video. The flight is just after upgrading the copter to Betaflight 3.2 with minimal tuning, so if you see the tiniest bit of propwash, that's why. \n\nI think you'll see that the motors are pretty powerful, although not as face-rippingly powerful as some racing motors. You'll be amazed to learn that full throttle punchouts were peaking around 85 amps! Flight times were closer to 3:00 or 3:30 than 2:00 or 2:30 like with some \"ball-ripping\" racing motors. Also notice how good the motor's response is on the sharp snappy rolls. Zero bounceback. Of course I was able to disable all the static filters in Betaflight and use just the dynamic notch while still coming down with cool motors.\n\nI can't say that the Rotor Riot HypeTrain is the best freestyle motor on the market today, because there are too many great motors that I haven't tried. But I can say that after flying so many copters with battery-melting high-end racing motors, the HypeTrain is a breath of fresh air."

It's the parallel charge board I always wished somebody would make. \nOkay... I know that's not sexy like a frame or a flight controller, but charging our packs is something we all have to do, and parallel charging is, simply put, the ONLY fast and cheap way of charging lots of smaller packs, like mini quad pilots use.\n\n--- Product Link: https://goo.gl/FqtQGG ---\n\nWhat makes this board so good is that it only has 4S balance ports. If you have a bunch of 3S, 5S, and 6S batteries, this isn't for you. But the vast majority of us have a ton of 4S packs. So get rid of all those un-used balance ports, and now you have enough room on the board to fit TEN plugs. Most other boards have either 4 or 6.\n\nDid you know that the fuses on most other boards are direct-soldered to the board? If you burn one out, you can't just pull it out of a housing and slide a new one in. When I first learned this, my jaw was on the floor. So the fuses in this board are in proper housings, and if you make a mistake and burn one out, you can easily replace it. No soldering iron required.\n\nThis board comes with an XT60 plug for ISDT chargers, and an adapter for chargers that take banana plugs.\n\nFinally, the board has a built-in voltage checker so you can easily check the voltage level of batteries before plugging them in. Just plug them in one at a time before plugging all of them in to the board for charging!\n\n--- Product Link: https://goo.gl/FqtQGG ---"

People have had their radio fail even when SWR is low. Even when they are good at soldering. Even when they cut the coax to 84mm like you are supposed to. Even when the use an anti-static strap!\n\nIf you have a Taranis Special Edition with the SMA connector already installed, it seems likely that you will be fine. It's completely unclear what it is about the home-made modifications that damages the boards, vs. the factory modification which presumably is okay or FrSky would really be in trouble.\n\nIf you have done this mod years ago and have had no problem at all with it, good for you. Not everybody will be affected.

So is there even a point to running this motor at all??? I started to wonder if Emax was just playing a numbers game: if 2205 is good, then 2306 must be better!\n\nTo help answer the question, I called in Ryan Harrell, whose web site, http://miniquadtestbench.com, is THE compendium of motor and ESC data.

All I want to do is respond to Preston's accusation that my assertion is irresponsible and unfounded.\n\n---\n\nSection 6 of the GPL v3 describes five ways that non-source code can be conveyed. Of those, only section 6d is consistent with what Raceflight was doing, during the period where they closed the github repo to public access, and were distributing .bin files via the Slack channel. k\n\nSection 6d requires that source be available from the same place as the non-source file, which as far as I know, it was not. The Raceflight source was not available from the Slack channel at the time that .bin files were being distributed there. In fact, I don't believe that it was publicly available at all. If this is true, it is a violation of the GPL.\n\nPreston and Kalyn have referred to \"responding to requests\" for source. They have said that they were not obligated to make the source available immediately. This is not consistent with my reading of the text of the GPL. Section 6d requires that the source be available from  the same place that the non-source file is located. Section 6b of the GPL allows one to distribute non-source code without accompanying source, and respond to requests for source, but section 6b only applies if you are distributing the non-source code on a physical medium, which they were not.\n\nPreston claims that you have to be an expert on the GPL to interpret it, but I disagree.

I eventually got a decent tune, but I'm still looking for the holy grail of micro quads: a durable, fun micro that flies just as precisely as a bigger quad.\n\nHoverbot is running a sale RIGHT NOW where you can get $50 off the Nano FPV kit, normally $250, now $200.

Let's put it this way: this is the ONLY budget RTF copter I've ever flown that I would even consider owning. At a price of $140 for the PnP version or $200 for the RTF version, if you're trying to get into drone racing on a shoestring, this is the one for you.\n\n---\n\nPurchase the Eachine Wizard X220 here: https://goo.gl/yDyngU\n---\n\nHOWEVER the durability of this copter is still to be determined! Flying well on day one is only the first hurdle that the copter has to overcome. How will it stand up to crashes? Check the playlist below for my complete review.\n\nProps in this video are Lumenier 5045 buttercutter. Thanks to Lumenier for sending them. These props really impress me with their durability.\n\n---\n\nMy STRONG recommendation is to NOT buy the RTF version because the transmitter that comes with it is not very good. Rather, get a Turnigy Evolution transmitter for about $70 or a Taranis QX7 for about $100 and the PnP version of the Wizard. You'll end up spending a little more but you'll get a MUCH better transmitter in the process.\n\n---\n\nFor more about this copter, including how to install the receiver, how to flash to Betaflight and configure, pro-tune PIDs, and flight testing, check out the other videos in this playlist:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwoDb7WF6c8lIEFkchf90RpSrZSwO8QeP\n\nThe purchase link above is an affiliate link.

      "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVeFSRPARjM",
      "description": "Watch my sticks move as I practice inverted yaw spins. Probably the most famous pilot who does this move is Charpu, but Mr. Steele also has some great examples of them. This move has always been hard for me for some reason, but I'm getting better!\n\n---\n\nI have a WHOLE tricks tutorial playlist full of content like this. Check it out here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwoDb7WF6c8mT1TB0iKaiUWRUVoT0Kk8O\n\n---\n\nThe key to inverted yaw spins is to level your copter relative to the horizon before you spin. Since your camera is up-tilted, this isn't as simple as centering the horizon in the goggles. If the copter is flat relative to the horizon, then when you spin, the horizon will stay flat. If your copter is tilted relative to the horizon, then when you spin, the horizon will roll all over the place and the move won't look awesome. This is the same reason why you need to coordinate turns with yaw and roll when flying right-side up. In theory, you could coordinate an inverted yaw spin with roll, and do it at any angle, but so far I haven't been able to pull that off. It just makes my brain hurt.\n\n---\n\nEquipment List:\n\nFrame: Lumenier QAV-R - https://goo.gl/hYfgQR\nMotors: Rotorgeeks 7075 series 2205/2700kv - https://goo.gl/gF9uZT\nESCs: Rotorgeeks RG20 Plus - https://goo.gl/Mj8q2r\nProps: KingKong 5x4x3 - https://goo.gl/PqheEv\nFC: Fury F3 - https://goo.gl/EHXPKb\nBetaflight 3.0.1\nPDB/OSD: RROSD - https://goo.gl/6iJCMs\nFPV Cam: RunCam Eagle 4:3 - https://goo.gl/DWWZuL\nHD Cam: GoPro Session 5\n\n---\n\nA while back, I was working on a tutorial for this move, and then Vek FPV made a great one! So if you want a detailed tutorial, here it is: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blxYLCmhF58\n\nRotor Riot also has a tutorial on inverted yaw spins, but I think they skim over the most important part, which is to level the copter relative to the horizon. Ummagawd hits on it briefly but then when the n00b is having trouble, Charpu focuses really heavily on his rates and his timing, overlooking that if he was level relative to the horizon, he could exit at any angle and the trick would work. The RR guys are much better pilots than me so maybe I'm missing something important. But I think possibly they're just better pilots than they are tutors. Mad respect! \n\nThe Rotor Riot tutorial is here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnj2Rggr55s"

It flies perfectly on a massively wide range of PIDs. The quadcopter will fly pretty well regardless. Locked in. Smooth.

This may be a good quadcopter for you because it's hard to make a mistake.\n\nProps in this build are KingKong 5x4x3. I strongly recommend using a prop like this instead of the 5045x3 props that the quadcopter came with. Those props give a bit more thrust but are generally less tunable. But on this quadcopter, who knows?\n\nMy final PIDs:\n\nRoll P/I/D - 75/40/30\nPitch P/I/D - 75/50/30\nYaw P/I - 115/30\n\nThis is on Betaflight 3.0.1 with all other settings default.\n\n---\n\nUse coupon code \"Joshua10\" for $10 off the FlyPro XJaguar.

Modern OSDs are easy to install, reliable, and offer as much (or as little) functionality as you want.\n\nHere are four different ways to put an OSD onto your quadcopter. \n\n---\n\nhttps://goo.gl/s0sW4v\n\nThe Holybro PDBOSD v1.2 follows the familiar model of the RROSD and the HubOSD. The OSD is integrated into the PDB, and since you were going to install a PDB anyway, there's no additional work to include the PDB. Unlike the RROSD, the Holybro PDBOSD v1.2 uses MWOSD so it integrates with your flight controller to let you change PIDs and so forth in the field.\n\n---\n\nhttps://goo.gl/ETJG5F\n\nThe Furious FPV Passado combines an OSD and video transmitter (vTX) into a 36mm stackable board. One feature that makes it stand out is that it can be turned on and off via an Aux channel, to avoid stomping on other people at the flight field by accident.\n\n---\n\nThe DMT video transmitter from UBAD puts the OSD into the vTX! This product is not released yet at the time of making this video.\n\n--\n\nhttps://goo.gl/EflWJ6\n\nThe RROSD v2 is the evolution of the original PDB+OSD board. Unlike the Holybro PDBOSD, this one is completely self-contained. It doesn't integrate with the FC, so there's no configuration or calibration or UARTs or etc. Just solder it up and go. The RROSD v2 has an improved pad layout and better voltage regulators than the v1, as well as a much higher current rating."

The reason for this is that you need the motors spinning as slowly as possible while inverted to maximize your hang time.\n\nFor more of this type of content, STICKS OVERLAY VIDEOS PLAYLIST IS HERE - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwoDb7WF6c8lK61tGcmeCopKS07Wwc4Gt\n\nEquipment List:\n\nFrame: Lumenier QAV-R - https://goo.gl/hYfgQR\nMotors: Rotorgeeks 7075 series 2205/2700kv - https://goo.gl/gF9uZT\nESCs: Rotorgeeks RG20 Plus - https://goo.gl/Mj8q2r\nProps: KingKong 5x4x3 - https://goo.gl/PqheEv\nFC: Fury F3 - https://goo.gl/EHXPKb\nBetaflight 3.0.1\nPDB/OSD: RROSD - https://goo.gl/6iJCMs\nFPV Cam: RunCam Eagle 4:3 - https://goo.gl/DWWZuL\nvTX - TS5823\nAntenna: Foxeer \"Unbreakable\" 5.8G Circular Polarized\n\nThe music is from http://www.epidemicsound.com/.

But I was never able to get it flying quite as well as I did the QX90.

      "description": "Please consider supporting me via Patreon at: https://www.patreon.com/thedroneracingengineer\n\nIf you purchase a QQ190 RTF racing drone, you want a great tune. Here's my approach to developing the tune for this quadcopter. Of course you can just copy my PIDs, since your copter is identical to mine.\n\nThe copter's electronics are: TBS PowerCube 2-in-1 BLHeli_S ESCs, Colibri flight controller, and FPVision OSD and vTX. The motors are T-Motor 2205/2400kv. Props are \"Skitzo\" branded HQ5x4x3.\n\nThe copter is available from: http://qq190racingdrone.com/\n\nHere are the relevant parts of my command-line dump if you want to transfer them to your copter. It's possible that your quadcopter will ship with these options already enabled, as I'm not sure what the final configuration will be when the quadcopters ship.\n\n---\n\nfeature AIRMODE\n\nrxfail 3 h\nset failsafe_delay = 5\n\nset min_throttle = 1045\nset motor_pwm_protocol = MULTISHOT\nset small_angle = 45\n\nset p_pitch = 50\nset i_pitch = 80\nset d_pitch = 45\nset p_roll = 50\nset i_roll = 50\nset d_roll = 50\nset p_yaw = 115\nset i_yaw = 45\n\nset rc_rate = 155\nset rc_rate_yaw = 100\nset rc_expo = 0\nset rc_yaw_expo = 0\nset roll_srate = 70\nset pitch_srate = 70\nset yaw_srate = 75\n\n---\n\nI swear to god it is a complete coincidence that all of the roll gains are 50.\n\nIf you want to explore a slightly softer and smoother tune, reduce yaw P gradually to as low as perhaps 70 or 80. At that point, I would personally feel the copter did not turn in sharply enough, but maybe you will like it better somewhere between 80 and 115. But try 115 first!"

You can use a switch to activate Angle Mode, Horizon Mode, Air Mode, the beeper, and any other flight mode you want. The same process can be used to set up switch arming too, which by the way, I do recommend.\n\nI'll be using my FrSky Taranis for this example, but the same procedure can be used with any other common transmitter, such as Spektrum or FlySky. The only difference will be in the steps for assigning the switch to an Aux channel. Sorry I can't help with that if you don't have a Taranis."

      "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBaefeQtA1c",
      "description": "This may be the most common question I see asked about multirotors, so clearly it's one that deserves an explanation. Why do your quadcopter motors spin faster and slower when you arm the copter with the props off? Or sometimes, two motors spin faster and two motors spin slower? This phenomenon happens in Cleanflight, Betaflight, and probably KISS and Raceflight too (although I can't confirm it).\n\nHere's the answer.\n\nThe answer is that the PID controller is trying to compensate for the random vibrations that are coming from the motors. Since the motors don't have props on, the PID controller can't have any effect. Since it's having no effect, it keeps trying harder and harder (the motors spin faster). This creates a feedback loop  which results in the motors spinning up and up.\n\nWhat should you do when this happens? I'll tell you in this video.\n\nPS: Since I know you're going to ask, the copter in the video is the Holybro Shuriken X1."

If you missed the original video, go watch it and try to come up with your own answer first. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4zl1qkX-BQ\n\nThe sequence of events that I observed was:\n\n1. Copter tips back/left.\n2. Betaflight OSD shows summary stats screen.\n3. Betaflight OSD shows \"Armed\"\n4. Copter hits the ground upside down. vTX goes to static.\n5. I hit the disarm switch about here.\n6. Betaflight OSD shows the startup screen.\n\nConclusions:\n\nThis was not an ESC or motor issue like a desync because that could not cause the OSD to do the things it did.\n\nThis was not simply a brown-out because the OSD disarmed and rearmed before power cycling. Likely that hitting the ground caused the power cycle, independent of the issue that caused the crash.\n\nOSD going to summary stats indicate that the FC perceived a disarm. Disarm was not caused by me flipping the switch. It was not caused by an FC failsafe, because the controls did not lock up, therefore no stage-1 failsafe occurred. The fact that the copter re-armed indicates that stage-2 failsafe did not occur.\n\nMost likely explanation (IMO) is that the receiver went into failsafe, but the receiver did not go \"no pulses\". Rather, the receiver went to some fixed value of channel settings that resulted in a disarm. This would be possible since I use switch arming, so changing just a single Aux channel to 1500 would kill the copter. \n\nThe receiver in this copter is not my usual X4R. It is a mini SBUS receiver that I scavenged from a broken QX90, so reduced range is consistent with this explanation."

      "description": "One of the biggest reasons I love the RedRotor RROSD is that its current sensor comes pre-calibrated. But there are lots of great OSD options out there that require you to manually calibrate the current sensor. If you've got one of them, here's how to get it reading accurately.\n\nThanks to Furious FPV for providing the Kombini that I'm using to do this calibration. However this approach will work for cleanflight, betaflight, MWOSD, or any other similar current sensor."

      "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLsMBChQLKo",
      "description": "The RedRotor RROSD has a built-in current sensor that allows the OSD to show current and mAh without any effort on the part of the user. This is, in my opinion, one of its strongest selling points. But many people on the RROSD support thread on rcgroups say that their current sensor is inaccurate. RedRotor has actually added the ability to calibrate your current sensor by +/-20% in response to these requests. But I've always found my RROSD current sensors to be perfectly accurate, when compared to my meters, and I've suspected that something may not be adding up.\n\nThe problem is that people are determining the accuracy of their RROSD current sensor by looking at how much charge their battery charger puts back into the battery. If they draw out 1000 mAh and the charger puts back in 1200 mAh, they conclude that the current sensor is inaccurate. I'm suspicious of this approach.\n\nThe RROSD combines a PDB and OSD in one. The main advantage of this is that the current sensor has to be on the PDB, so co-locating it with the OSD keeps everything neat and tidy. You can purchase the RROSD here: \n\nhttp://www.redrotorrc.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=115"

      "description": "WARNING: If you do this hack, you CANNOT charge through your main discharge lead anymore. The reason is that the charger will think the battery is at 4.5 volts / cell and will refuse to charge it. You MUST charge ONLY through the balance lead. Here is the charger that I use to do that: \n\nhttp://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__7637__Turnigy_12v_2_3S_Basic_Balance_Charger.html\n\nGet the Pololu step-up regulator here: \n\nhttps://www.pololu.com/product/2116\n\n---\n\nYou might be familiar with the Fatshark Goggle Hack, where you build a 2S pack out of commodity 18650 lithium cells. The result is a pack not much larger than the Fatshark 1800 mAh pack, but with almost 2x the capacity. But there's a catch! The Fatshark goggles themselves will shut down when the battery gets down to about 7 volts, and they start beeping at you around 7.2 volts. Which means you can't actually use a good chunk of the battery's capacity!\n\nIn this video, I show you how to install a 9v step-up regulator in your battery pack, so that the output voltage stays at 9v ... well, pretty much forever. And that's a good and a bad thing. Because it means you can draw your batteries all the way down to 3.0 volts per cell and get their FULL capacity, but also it means you can draw your batteries all the way down to 1.5 volts per cell and destroy them, and you'll never know the difference.\n\nIf that doesn't scare you off, proceed."

      "description": "FinalGlideAus suggests running a GoPro Hero 1/2 lens on your FPV camera--and i agree. The GoPro lens gives a field of view in between that of a 2.8mm and a 2.1mm lens, and has great overall image quality. But why not just use a 2.5mm lens that's designed for the image sensor in the camera? The answer, as I think this video shows, is that the 2.5mm lens has very unpleasant distortion around the edge of the frame, whereas the GoPro lens has almost no distortion. I think one possible reason for this is that the GoPro is designed for a much larger image sensor, so the FPV camera is using only the center portion of the lens, where image quality is higher and distortion is lower.\n\nThis is the exact GoPro lens that I buy for my 1177 cameras. \n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Vicdozia-Replacement-Degree-Camera-SJ4000/dp/B015EE7G58/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1476651030&sr=8-2&keywords=gopro+lens\n\nPlease be aware that FGA says that GoPro Hero 3/4 lenses don't work, although I haven't personally verified this."

      "description": "Because the ClearView is not a traditional diversity receiver, this test was not performed using the same antennas as the other receivers. The diversity receivers in the test used one ImmersionRC 8 dBi patch antenna and one Foxeer cloverleaf antenna. The Clearview was using two Foxeer cloverleaf antennas. This means that, for the first half of the test, where the other receivers were operating on their patch antennas, the ClearView was at a 6 dB disadvantage. For perspective, 6 dB of signal strength equates to a doubling or halving of signal range. In other words, if the Clearview went as far as the others, it actually went twice as far, due to its handicap."

      "description": "Please consider supporting me via Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/thedroneracingengineer\n\nThis video will show you how to flash BLHeli to the ESCs on your Eachine Falcon 210. The ESCs on the Falcon are not great, but they can be improved by replacing the Flycolor firmware they come with, with BLHeli. In order to do that, you have to flash the ESCs over the C2 interface. The C2 interface is how you program the Silabs chip on the ESC directly, vs. over the signal wire like you usually do it. Once you have flashed BLHeli to the ESCs the first time, you can do it over the signal wire via BLHeli passthrough after that.\n\nIf you want to flash BLHeli to any other ESC, the steps are the same, but this video specifically targets the Eachine Falcon 210."

But the Alien is a very popular frame and it's in that same price range, so I think it's interesting to see what else you could get if you were one of the people who wanted to pay that much for a quadcopter frame.\n\nSpecs:\n\nArms available in 3mm thick, 210mm wheelbase; 4mm thick, 210mm wheelbase; 3mm thick, 250mm wheelbase.\n\nWeight: 111g (arms not specified, but I would guess 3mm / 210mm).\n\n#skullndrones\n#skullanddrones\n#fpv"

      "description": "In this video, I muddle my way through the internal install of the LaForge module and diversity module in my Dominator HD2 goggles. There are several very good instructional videos on YouTube showing how to do this. This is NOT an instructional video. This is just one guy fumbling around and eventually getting it done, and I figured y'all might like to watch me do it.\n\nLong story short, I got it done and it works. A few points.\n\n1) I am installing LaForge because it was the first one to hit my doorstep. I will be testing Furious True-D, Clearview, Nexwave, and any of the other modules that I can get a hold of. Look for the test results in the next month or so on my channel It depends on how fast the product gets here and how long the testing takes. Because this is such an important decision, I want to actually live with the modules a bit before reviewing them.\n\n2) Thanks to a commenter on the livestream for suggesting putting foam behind the diversity module if you get light leaks. I used the very foam from my LaForge boxes. Stuff it in the part where the head strap goes too. Zero light leak.\n\n3) I did not end up modifying the diversity side of the goggle case at all. I'm not sure if the V2 diversity module is different than the V1 or what, but it fits in okay with no modification. I can't really see where I would mod anyway, if I did. For the time being, I simply have duct tape over the diversity module and some double-sided foam tape to hold it in. Once my testing is done and I decide which of the modules I will end up keeping, I will figure out a more permanent solution.\n\n4) The video is blurry because I used my Galaxy S6 as a RTSP web-cam in order to get the video into my streaming program. For whatever reason, the video was very blurry. I tried all possible encoding and resolution settings. I also checked to be sure and it is NOT a focus issue on the camera. The image is soft at all focal distances. I won't be using this option again, but for tonight, it was what I had. I am a terrible YouTub-er. Sorry.\n\nThanks to Bruce at UBAD (http://ubuyadrone.com/fpv-gear/laforge-line-up/) for providing the LaForge."

The next biggest thing you can do is put a decent camera on it.

On the last night in town, I smashed my QAV-R into a metal sign post and thoroughly destroyed it. Don't worry. It's fine now.\n\nThe police officer was perfectly pleasant. I only show the interaction because it's hilarious that she showed up right as we were examining my destroyed copter. And everybody knows that police encounters drive YouTube hits...\n\nOh, and yes, I did miss two gates on my first lap and not go back around to get them. I actually didn't 100% know the course. But since I totally destroyed my copter trying to finish the race, I hope you'll cut me some slack.\n\nPPS: The Quadrysteria 3D printed Yi mount was actually fine. The screws all pulled out but there was no damage to the mount and it went back together again good as new."

      "description": "Please consider supporting me via Patreon at: https://www.patreon.com/thedroneracingengineer\n\nBetaflight 3.0's new 2 degree-of-freedom PID controller is one of its most exciting features. Let's learn what the new \"setpoint weight\" sliders do! I also discuss the new RC interpolation feature.\n\nError in a PID controller can be separated into externally-induced error and error caused by moving the set-point. The 2DOF PID controller allows you to distinguish between these two types of error. In other words, it allows you to control how aggressively the PID controller responds to your stick movements.\n\nP term setpoint weight basically controls overshoot. Higher P term setpoint weight results in sharper stick response, lower P gains, and more overshoot and oscillation. Lower P term setpoint weight results in softer stick response, higher P gains, and less overshoot and oscillation.\n\nD term setpoint weight is harder to describe. Higher D term setpoint weight results in an overall much sharper and more precise flight feel. But it also makes the copter fly less smoothly, since it is responding exactly to every little wiggle and jiggle of the stick. Lower D term setpoint weight results in a smoother, more \"organic feeling\" flight experience, but also a softer and less precise one."

Let's see how much performance I can wring out of this one!\n\nThis video is broken up into four segments:\n\n0:00 - I fly the Shuriken with totally stock PIDs and rates. Exactly how it came out of the box.\n\n1:42 - I fly again with stock PIDs, but this time I raise the rates to something closer to what I normally fly. Now the aerobatic maneuvers are more like you are used to seeing from me.\n\n3:53 - I do a rough tune on the PIDs. I could probably get them a little bit better with some more work, but this is a decent first pass.\n\n8:08 - I flash the copter to Betaflight 3.0 and fly on the default PIDs.

If you are an all-out racer trying to get the absolute most from your setup, this is not the prop for you. If you are a freestyle or fun flyer trying to balance performance, tunability, and price, I think this is a fantastic choice.\n\nAs much as I like these props, they are not as durable as the two-blade version that I have flown forever. The hub on these props is a little thinner, and they are more likely to lose a blade entirely, or even for the hub to crack.

      "description": "As suggested by FinalGlideAus, I tried a GoPro lens on my HS1177 FPV camera. The result is something in between a 2.1mm and a 2.8mm, and I like it a lot. See for yourself!\n\nI am told that this does NOT work on the RunCam Swift because it is slightly different dimensions than the 1177. I am told that the lens will screw in, but it hits the sensor before the image comes into focus. I haven't personally verified this, though.\n\nThe exact lens that I ordered is this one, but you can find the same product all over eBay and elsewhere on the Internet.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Vicdozia-Replacement-170%C2%B0Degree-Camera-SJ4000/dp/B015EE7G58/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1469496134&sr=8-1&keywords=gopro+170+lens"

So I've been trying out some DYS 5x4x3 props that I ordered a while back. These DYS props are not well balanced, so they are pretty challenging to tune. If you see some D-term bobbles in my flight, that's why. But they sure are fun to fly. See for yourself.\n\nI'm intentionally posting this video the day after my \"Tsunami Acro\" video, so you can compare the performance of the three-blade vs. two-blade props against each other. To be fair, I have also switched from Betafilght 2.7.1 to 2.9.0, and have re-tuned. But I think the difference that the props are causing should still be apparent. Does the copter look faster in the straights and punches? Does it look to track better in turns vs. sliding out?\n\nParts List:\n\nLumenier QAV-R frame (GetFPV.com)\nXracer F303 v2.1 (FPVMode.coml)\nBetaflight 2.9.1 @ 4k/2k Oneshot125\nRotorgeeks RG20 Plus ESC (Rotorgeeks.com) / BLHeli 14.6\nRotorgeeks 7075 2205/2700kv motors (Rotorgeeks.com)\nDYS 5x4x3 Props\nFoxeer XAT600 / HS1177 (Atees.com)\nFrSky X4R-SB receiver (Atees.com)\nTS5823 200 mW vTX\nAomway cloverleaf antenna"

Oneshot125 with 8kHz gyro and 2kHz PID rate.\n\nBattery used is a 1300 mAh 4S.

This video shows you how to set up a \"sticky\" arming switch on your Taranis. A \"sticky\" arming switch means that you hold the momentary switch for a half second or so to arm, but disarm instanatly with a throw of the non-momentary switch. This means that you can't arm accidentally, but you can still instantly disarm if needed during a crash. This really is the best of both worlds, and should completely eliminate the need for anyone to ever stick arm. (That controversial statement is intentionally placed to stir up trouble. Please ignore it.)"

I've always said that more uptilt = more speed = more awesome, but I'm starting to think there's a limit. First, more speed means less precision in tight proximity situations. Second, more uptilt means more yaw coupling on roll moves, and I've found that camera uptilt compensation may have subtle effects that I don't like. I'm not sure, but I've turned it off. So anyway, I bumped from about 45 degrees down to about 30 degrees, and this is the result. What do you think?\n\n(Incidentally, I don't mean to suggest it's impossible to have amazing acro with high uptilt, but we all can't be Matty can we?)\n\nSetup:\n\nLumenier QAV-R Frame (GetFPV)\nRotorgeeks 7075 Series 2205 2700kv motors (Rotorgeeks)\nRotorgeeks RG20 Plus 20A F390 ESC (Rotorgeeks)\nBLHeli 14.6\nKingKong 5040 prop\nXracer F303 Flight Controller (FPV Model)\nBetaflight 2.7.1\nFrSky X4R-SB receiver (Atees)\nHS1177 camera (Surveilzone)\nTS5823 vTX (myrcmart.com)"

The DTFc contains a current sensor, so you can get current telemetry with no additional hardware (assuming you have a telemetry system set up of course). If you want an OSD, the DTFc is compatible with OSDoge.\n\nThe DTFc contains a different IMU (gyro) chip than most boards on the market today. On paper, its specs are on par with the MCU6000 and 6050, which are the gold standard for multirotors at least in the current market. But some people have reported glitches, which leads to two conclusions. First, there is something else going on other than just paper specs that is leading to these glitches. And second, soft-mounting an FC is always a good idea."

In this video, I discuss this question, and show you how to baseline the vibration level of your motors so that you'll know when they're ready to retire.\n\nI am using the RotorGeeks 7075 series 2205/2700kv motors, provided by RotorGeeks for this purpose.

      "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQtgKLtzKTk",
      "description": "The answer to this one is that there is a loss of connectivity between the receiver and the flight controller. Key pieces of information include:\n\nCopter will not re-arm until power cycle is almost always an indication of failsafe. There is almost nothing else in cleanflight that will cause this to occur. The copter refusing to arm at all is simply an indication that the failsafe event happened before you started flying.\n\nThe copter did not have a buzzer, but if it did, we would hear the S-O-S beep pattern that indicates failsafe. This is one reason why I always put buzzers on my copters. They're invaluable for troubleshooting.\n\nWe know that the failsafe must be between the receiver and the flight controller because the OSD shows 80%+ signal strength all the way to the ground. Also, the Taranis did not give any audio warning (\"RSSI Critical\") or anything like that.\n\nTo fix the issue, I powered the copter on the bench. Fortunately, the F303 powers the receiver from USB, so there was no need to plug in a battery and risk the motors spinning up. I wiggled and fiddled with the receiver to see if I could reproduce the problem. Ultimately, loosening the zip tie holding the receiver to the copter was what fixed the issue."

      "description": "Please consider supporting me via Patreon at: https://www.patreon.com/thedroneracingengineer\n\nIn this series, I take you through the entire process of PID tuning a quadcopter, from the very first maiden to the final tune. In order to make the process accessible to more people, all tuning is done using FPV video only. No Blackbox analysis is used in this process at all, although we will look at the Blackbox logs that result, just for perspective, after the tune is finished.\n\nIn part 1 of the series, I perform the initial maiden flight and get the general feel of the copter. The copter has obvious low I gain. It shows no signs of excess P gain. As a result, I raise both these values. In the second flight, P term oscillation starts to appear, indicating that P gain may be a bit high, or perhaps just right. I gain is still not quite high enough on roll in the 2nd flight, but pitch is close to correct.\n\n--\n\nEquipment list:\n\nFrame: Shendrones Mixuko (From Atees.com -- thanks, Atees!)\nMotors: RCX 2205/2633kv\nProps: KingKong 5040\nESCs: Littlebee 20A\nFlight Controller: FPV Model Xracer F303\nOSD / PDB: RedRotor RROSD Pro\nReceiver: FrSky X4R-SB\nFPV Camera: HS1177\nVideo Transmitter: TS5823\n\nAll-up weight with 1300 mAh 4S battery is about 435g."

      "description": "The \"CYT\" series invites you to analyze an RC flight problem. After a bit, the answer, and correct analysis is posted.\n\nHere is some information that is relevant to the problem.\n\n1) No buzzer is installed on the copter.\n2) Although I have given you blackbox overlay so you can see the sticks, please assume that blackbox logging is not available. This problem does not require blackbox for analysis.\n3) The transmitter is a Taranis and the receiver is an X4R-SB. No telemetry alarms went off when the incident occurred.\n4) Sometimes the copter will refuse to arm entirely. Sometimes it will fly for a few seconds and then drop out of the sky.\n\nThere is one more piece of information that I am intentionally withholding that would be a dead giveaway what the problem was. If you ask the right question, I will give you the truthful answer, but I'm not going to volunteer the information because it would make diagnosing the problem obvious to at least some of you."

Then remove the hot glue that holds the lens in place with a needle-nose pliers or hemostat or something like that. Screw out the damaged lens and screw in the replacement. Now focus the lens. Once the lens is focused, put a little bit of hot glue in place to hold it in place. Finally, reassemble the lens.\n\nIt might be a good idea to do the Yi microphone mod while you have the camera open.

This video is still relevant, but watch this one next: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHkofDq_JxU\n\nPropwash oscillation is one of the hardest multirotor / quadcopter tuning issues to deal with. Basic steps to dealing with propwash oscillation include lowering P gain, if appropriate, and raising D gain--again, if appropriate. What's \"appropriate\"? Watch the video and see!\n\nTo really kill propwash oscillation, you may need to upgrade your kit. Running at higher gyro sync frequencies (2 kHz vs. 4 kHz vs. 8 kHz) usually helps. Having a more noise-free copter with less filtering helps. Running multishot helps. And having an ESC with a hardware PWM driver such as KISS or BLHeli_S helps.\n\nJust a discussion video, no actual flight examples because I'm slammed with other stuff but I didn't want to wait to get the information out there. Hope it's helpful, and I'll possibly follow up with a flight video later."

The takeaway from this video is that if your copter was tuned great yesterday and then your traces start looking terrible, it's probably that something mechanical has changed. Chasing the mechanical issue around with the tune is not the right approach... fix the mechanical issue!\n\nThis is a great example of how a focus on and awareness of tuning helps you track down mechanical issues with your copter. At high throttle, my copter started acting like it had excess D gain even though I hadn't changed the tune at all. This is indicative of an increase in gyro noise. It took me a little while to finally accept that conclusion, but if I wasn't paying close attention to the tune, I might have missed the issue entirely."

It is a famous test track for cars, because it includes a little bit of everything.\n\nIn order to avoid spoiling others' search results, I'm not putting Nurburgring in the title, though, instead calling the course the Grand Tour.

      "description": "Please consider supporting me via Patreon at: https://www.patreon.com/thedroneracingengineer\n\nWhen you have camera uptilt, your rolls start including more and more yaw. When you are flying normally, you can learn to compensate for this. But when you do snap-rolls, the camera doesn't pivot around the center of the field of view, and this can be undesirable in some circumstances. In this video, I'll show you how to compensate for camera uptilt using a technique I call cross-coordination.\n\nThis whole video is done from the perspective of, \"your FPV camera has uptilt and you can use cross-coordination to cancel out the uptilt.\" If your camera doesn't have any uptilt, then you can play with the opposite of this. Instead of doing just rolls, add some yaw in the same direction, to cause your rolls to look as if your camera did have uptilt."

See here for more info: http://fpvlab.com/forums/showthread.php?45118-Xiaomi-Yi-SuperView-Mod-(-more!)\n\nNo FPV video because I left the DVR sitting on the trunk of my car. Big metal object = lots of multipath. The DVR footage is basically unusable.\n\nLanding with 43 degrees uptilt was hard, since I had basically no visual reference to work off of. Even the light posts were useless because the light blew out the rest of the image and I couldn't see the pole to tell what the copter was doing. I used the \"turn to kill velocity then lower throttle and hope for the best\" method. I'd say about 8/10 landings, I stayed upright, but of course not on this one.\n\nI forgot to turn the audio level down on the original upload, so I stuck some awesome YouTube music on top to make the overall volume something tolerable. Enjoy!"

      "description": "Please consider supporting me via Patreon at: https://www.patreon.com/thedroneracingengineer\n\nA front flip may be one of the first aerobatic moves that an FPV acro quadcopter pilot learns. This tutorial shows a variant on that move where the copter is rolled sideways before the flip is performed. At first, this may seem disorienting, but this video shows that there's no reason to be scared of the move. You will also learn an unexpected way to exit this move, by using yaw instead of roll, that makes the exit of the move much smoother and more appealing to viewers."

Nothing in here that you haven't seen before, but view counts show that people REALLY like the stick overlay videos, so for those who want it, enjoy. \r\n\r\nI really love that, with this copter on these motors and these props, I can thrash it around with impunity. I can whip into a 180 and give 100% throttle without fear that I'm going to run out of authority and drop an arm. The motors and props are super responsive! This is as much a function of the GREATLY reduced weight of this copter compared to my Strider, as it is a function of the motors and props themselves.\r\n\r\nIf you compare this video to \"Gravity is no Impediment,\" you'll probably see that the copter is not quite as fast on the KK5040's as it was on the HQ5x4x3's I was using in that video. But for $0.25 per prop compared to $1.30 per prop, I'll take it."

If you have something like this, consider raising min_throttle by five points or so. The reason I don't think this was a desync is due in large part to the fact that there was no audible screech or squeal. \n\nMany people are having issues like this where an arm drops at the end of a flip or roll. If that happens, consider raising min_throttle by a bit. My experience is that min_throttle must be at least about 15 points above the point where the motors first spin up to avoid this from happening during aggressive moves in flight.\n\n---\n\nRunning HQ5045BN props on RCX2205/2633kv motors. ESCs are Littlebee 20A running BLHeli 14.4, medium timing, low demag compensation. IMO, this is a clear sign that this prop is too aggressive for these lower-torque motors. Possibly, this could be fixed with adjustments to timing, but given that there are much better all-around props for this motor, it's hardly worth the effort.\n\nIn this case, the motor was able to regain sync and the copter stabilized. This doesn't always happen with desync, but it often does.\n\nPS: In case you're wondering why I was running those props on these motors, the answer is that I broke all my other props, and this was what a friend had to lend me. So it was this, or pack it in for the day."

The Bolt battery beat the Nano-tech on every lap except the first, which was likely due to a slower start (i.e. piloting). Average lap time for the Bolt was 9.62 seconds. Average lap time for the Nano-tech was 10.27 seconds.\n\nThe copter is my Strider Flex. For those who are keeping track, this was before I increased the uptilt on the camera. The up-tilt during these runs was about 30 degrees. These runs are with an AUW of 755 grams for the Nano-tech and 735 grams for the Bolt.

      "description": "I found another video on the SD card so I thought I'd post it for those who can't get enough of the sound of a tri-blade. On my Strider, I still prefer the KK5040 props, which is weird because I really think they are not an optimal match for my 2206 / 2250kv motors. But the copter seems to track much better in corners on the 5040, and actually corner smoother and with more control.\n\nI tried these props today on my QAV-R build. AUW is only 600 grams with Xiaomi Yi, vs. 680 grams for my Strider. The motors are 2206 / 2000 kv, so more torque and less amp draw. Also, closer to 210 mm motor distance vs. 250. The triples felt like a better fit here, although I am still tuning and who knows, if I try the 5040s maybe I'll love them.\n\nIt feels to me like the 5040s do better on a slightly smaller, slightly higher-kv motor, while the triples do better on a larger, lower-kv motor. This isn't exactly a ground-breaking insight."

This is not so much a review, as an analysis of the specifications of each charger, to help you decide which one might best fit your needs. This video is a culmination of a series of videos on how to analyze battery charger specifications, which you can find here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwoDb7WF6c8kuI5UdXNbB-Y9Kxhu0FAt3\n\nChargers in this review are:\n\nTurnigy Accucel-6 80W\nReaktor 250W 10A 6S\nNeutron 200W 10A 6S HV Touchscreen\nReaktor 300W 20A 6S\nReaktor 300W 20A 6S AC/DC\nReaktor 2x 300W 20A 6S\nReaktor 1000W 30A 6S\nReaktor 4x 300W 20A 6S\niCharger 308 Duo\n\n--\n\nI have to put a small addendum on what I said in the video. In the video, I said that the QuadKore charger might be good if you just hated parallel charging. That's not right. The QuadKore charger is 300 watts per channel, which is probably WAY more than most people are going to need to charge a single battery at 1C or 2C. These people could buy seven !!! Accucel-6 80 watt chargers for the price of the QuadKore and probably charge their small batteries even faster.\n\nThe QuadKore is ideal if you need 4x 300 watts. This is likely to mean that you are charging very big batteries, 6S batteries, or you are parallel charging. If you need to charge a lot of small batteries, a lot of small chargers may be a better choice."

      "description": "I compare the biggest and most popular F3 based multirotor flight control boards and give you the information you need to decide which one is best for you. If you're going to fly a drone racing quadcopter or fpv acro multirotor, you need a flight controller that is going to deliver serious performance. The good news is that ALL OF THESE BOARDS will run Cleanflight or Betaflight, which means EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM should fly equally well. That means that the only thing differentiating them is convenience features like extra UARTs, board layout, ease of build, reliability, and of course price. These are the exact factors that I discuss in this video.\n\n---\n\nIMPORTANT! Here is something I missed in this video. Both the Lux and the Cyclone lack a CP210 chip for their USB-to-serial conversion. Instead, they use a Virtual COM Port like the CC3D. This means that whenever the board reboots, the COM port goes away. Some people find this annoying because it takes some time for the O/S to restart the COM. Also, on some Windows machines, the COM port doesn't come back until you plug and un-plug the board. Other people don't find it inconvenient at all and wonder what all the fuss is about--it just takes a little longer to come back after you save changes.\n\nI say in the video that all F3 boards run through a VCP, but that isn't true. Some of them have the CP210 chip on board to let them act like a legit USB device. Only the Lux and Cyclone use a VCP.\n\nAnother side effect of VCP is that BLHeli passthrough does not work on the USB port. Rather, you have to connect an FTDI adapter to a UART. It is my understanding that support for proper (USB port) BLHeli passthrough on the Lux is currently under development, so this situation may change in the near future, but for now, this is the state of things as I understand it. UPDATE: As of Betaflight 2.6.1, BLHeli passthrough now works over VCP.\n\nIn this video, I cover:\n\nSPRacing F3\nSeriously Dodo\nMoto Tornado\nLumenier Lux\nMoto Cyclone\nCodelayer Singularity\nXRacer F303"

To perform the dead-stop, you pitch the multirotor back until it stops moving. Then you can punch out, flip or roll, or even back straight away. This move looks awesome in an acro flight, and it's even useful for avoiding crashing into things."

      "description": "Just got a Xiaomi Yi. You can get a script for it that emulates GoPro's SuperView feature as well as increasing the video bit-rate for better motion footage (such as, I don't know, FPV video). This is my first bashing around to see how the SuperView and the higher bit-rate looks. Obviously, YouTube is going to mangle the bit-rate, but what can you do?\n\nGet the Xiaomi Yi SuperView script here: http://fpvlab.com/forums/showthread.php?45118-Xiaomi-Yi-Enhanced-for-FPV-ers-(Script-Compilation)\n\nWhy is SuperView desirable? Because the GoPro and the Xiaomi Yi actually have a 4:3 image sensor. The Yi's sensor is 1920x1440. When you record at 1080p, the Yi simply crops the 1440 down to 1080. This produces an image with the correct dimensions, but it also means that you have less vertical field of view. SuperView uses the whole sensor, which means that you have more vertical field of view, but now you have a 4:3 image, and nobody wants that, so it stretches out the image to fill the 16:9 frame of a 1080p video. So you have some distortion due to the stretching, but everything is usually fisheyed anyway, so who cares? That's the theory anyway.\n\nIn practice, neither \"regular\" nor \"superview\" is definitively better. They both produce a different effect, and different people may prefer one or the other for different situations. The stretching of the superview mode may not be appropriate for human subjects where the stretching will be more obvious; the decreased vertical FOV for \"regular\" mode makes the subject look closer (might actually be good for some FPV since stuff looks more intense) and cuts more of the sky out of the frame, which simplifies exposure in some cases. \n\nThe above script can be edited to remove the \"superview\" lines while still keeping the increased video bit-rate, if desired.\n\nHere's a comparison of the GoPro Hero 3 in both modes. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZAHk4RJqK0"

WATCH THIS ONE INSTEAD: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FysPHx7RL9s\n\n---\n\nThis video will show you how to remap motor outputs in Cleanflight and Betaflight using the mixer and mmix command. The syntax of these commands is a little unintuitive, but not too complicated. This video will also show you some gotchas of using these commands that commonly trip up people who try to use them. First, you must set \"mixer custom\" or your custom mix won't take effect. Second, you can't skip mixer lines even if you don't intend to use a particular motor header. If that doesn't immediately make sense, the video will show it clearly.\n\nThere are several reasons why you might need to remap motor outputs in Cleanflight or Betaflight. One reason is if you have a bad motor header and need to move a motor to a different header. Another reason is if you are coming from OpenPilot and have your motors soldered to the board. OpenPilot uses a different motor layout than Cleanflight. Remapping motor outputs will let you keep the OpenPilot layout while switching to Cleanflight. A third reason is if you have a custom copter motor layout."

Enjoy!\n\nI think these clips really show the difference in flight dynamics between the two airframes and props. Our power system, AUW, and general piloting skill are roughly similar.\n\nAfter reviewing the day's flight video, I feel like a previous choice to raise my I gain was stiffening up my turning just a bit. So I feel like I could get a bit more nimbleness out of my copter, but nothing like the turn-on-a-dime ability of the 210."

      "description": "Quick summary for those who don't watch the whole video.\n\n1. Always make sure your ESC endpoints are correctly configured to match your flight controller's throttle endpoints. The easiest way to do this is to run throttle calibration using the Motors tab in CleanFlight.\n\n2. Once you have calibrated your ESC endpoints, disable \"Programming by TX\" in BLHeli to prevent noise on the signal line from ever accidentally mis-calibrating your ESCs (e.g. if you are working on your copter and power up the ESCs with the flight controller disconnected)."

If the radio link doesn't come back, then stage 2 failsafe activates, in which the copter can either shut down entirely, or try to auto-land."

It's possible this hack prevents you from using the S.Port, either to upgrade the firmware, or in general."

I took a suggestion from RCGroups and set up an \"idle up\" switch on my copter. The switch holds the throttle at zero when it is in the \"safe\" position. After using the stick to arm, the switch is flipped, which causes the throttle to work as normal, except the throttle curve stops just above min_throttle (or min_check, if your min_throttle is below your min_check). As a result, the FC never resets the I term when the copter is in the air."

You may already have the correct firmware! Put a blank, FAT-formatted SD card into the OpenLog. Power the OpenLog with 5v. Wait ten seconds. Power it down. Then remove the card. A file named CONFIG should be on the card. If the file contains only the \"baud\" parameter, you are good to go.\n\nSome OpenLog devices purchased from Amazon or eBay or Banggood do not work with the Arduino software. If you cannot get the board to flash, you may have this problem. The simplest thing to do if you are in the United States is to order an OpenLog device from MultirotorMania.com. Their devices so far have always shipped with the correct firmware already installed."

Because we are assuming that the aileron servos are set up inverse of each other, when the weights are the SAME (both positive or both negative), the ailerons will move OPPOSITE each other. Therefore, if we want spoilers, where both ailerons stick up, we need the weights to be DIFFERENT (one positive and one negative) so that the ailerons move the SAME direction. In other words, one weight should be 10 and the other weight should be -10. This will cause both ailerons to stick up 10%."
